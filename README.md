# Volatility Prediction Using Financial Time Series Data

This repository contains the Python code and Jupyter Notebook for predicting financial market volatility using various GARCH models and a Stochastic Volatility model implemented with PyMC3.

## Overview

The project aims to analyze and predict the volatility of financial instruments like stocks using time series data. We utilize models such as GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH, and Stochastic Volatility, each suited for capturing different aspects of volatility dynamics.
